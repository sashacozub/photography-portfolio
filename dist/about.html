                    <p>I was born and raised in Moldova, lived in USA, Russia, Asia and for a few last years I live in Oslo, Norway. I have visited just a few places around the world, and I have always admired the beauty of nature and the everchanging chaos of urban life. I love to capture the magnifisent nature, and the unique, living and breathing personality of cities and people living in them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I do photography for fun and a as something that I call "a professional hobby". I will always do it for myself, and will always share it with someone, who might share and enjoy the moments that I capture.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to the beloved topic of GEAR, then I should tell you, and you might have heard it somewhere before, it's not about the gear. Mostly. Would you guess which photos in my <a class="textLink" href="./portfolio.html">portfolio</a> are made with just my phone?</p>
